Hi Derek,

This is the poster template we provided to the students last year.
They were told they must have the SE, Qualcom, and UW logos on it; the
border; and that the dimensions are to be between 3'x4' and 4'8"x
5'10". There were no specifications for what you put inside the border
e.g. size of font, colour, images, etc.
